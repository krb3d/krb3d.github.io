I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a strong background in Backend technologies, including C#/.NET, Microsoft Azure Cloud, and SQL/NoSQL Databases, backed by over nine years in the IT and services industry. My academic focus was on Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering.

I specialize in developing backend applications, primarily for internal use, with a core emphasis on integrating existing software to solve critical business challenges. I believe well-designed backend systems are the foundation of successful digital ventures.

Beyond work, I'm passionate about staying current with technology trends and sharing knowledge with fellow enthusiasts.
